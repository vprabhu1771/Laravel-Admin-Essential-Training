The `php artisan admin:install` command in Laravel Admin performs several actions:

1. **Publishing Configuration**: Copies the configuration files of Laravel Admin to your application.
2. **Running Migrations**: Creates the necessary database tables for the Laravel Admin package.
3. **Seeding Data**: Seeds the database with the initial data required for the admin panel to function.

Here's a breakdown of what happens when you run `php artisan admin:install`:

1. **Publishing Configuration**:
   - The command publishes the configuration file (`config/admin.php`) to your application's config directory.
   
2. **Running Migrations**:
   - The command runs the necessary migrations to create tables such as `admin_users`, `admin_roles`, `admin_permissions`, `admin_menu`, etc.
   
3. **Seeding Data**:
   - The command seeds the database with initial data like the default admin user, roles, permissions, and menu items.

To execute the `php artisan admin:install` command successfully, ensure you have set up your database connection correctly in the `.env` file. 

**Steps to Install Laravel Admin:**

1. **Install Laravel Admin Package**:
   ```bash
   composer require encore/laravel-admin
   ```

2. **Run Installation Command**:
   ```bash
   php artisan admin:install
   ```

3. **Update `.env` File**:
   Ensure your `.env` file has the correct database configuration.

4. **Access Admin Panel**:
   After running the installation command, you can access the admin panel at `http://your-domain/admin`. The default login credentials are:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin`

**Example of a Successful Installation Output**:
```shell

If the `admin:install` command fails, check your database connection and migration files for any issues.
